This is a command line interface, created to aid in room booking according to your choice. The user will get 4 options on loading the interface on their terminals. 

#1 -> Create a new room
This will aid the user in registering their rooms according to their building, make sure their IDs are unique.

#2 -> Find available rooms
Basically a list of rooms are provided and henceforth, you can choose your room according to your timing, building or capacity preference. Clashing of times will result in an error and make sure the building names are properly typed.

#3 -> Book a room
After checking the availability of the rooms, you can book a room for an hour accordingly and to book for mulitple hours, you must do the booking step for the next hour too. 

#4 -> View a room's schedule
This is to get every detail about a particular room, even it's booked hours too.

And at last, there is the exit option, which when activated, all the rooms data will get saved to the .csv file and thus, can be reused later on, with all of it's details saved on it.

Thank you!
